# Laravel


## Get started

### Clone project

### Installing Laravel


### Run project

## Eloquent Models
## MVC Naming conventions
We put our views in folders and name them according to what we use them for, this can be seen in the pizza holder inside the views folder.


## File Generation
To generate a new model with associated migration and controller use this command:
```php artisan make:model <model_name> -mc```
The mc flag is used to make the migration and controller assiociated with the model.
